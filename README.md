# Advanced Continuous Monitoring System for Real-Time Performance Analytics in Linux Environment

The **Advanced Continuous Monitoring System** is a real-time monitoring tool designed for Linux environments, aimed at providing comprehensive insights into both system and container metrics. Built with open-source technologies, this tool captures, stores, and visualizes essential performance data, enabling proactive monitoring and resource optimization for DevOps environments. Utilizing **SAR** for Linux metrics, **InfluxDB** for time-series data storage, and **Grafana** for visualization, the system efficiently monitors CPU,
memory, network, and IO metrics, as well as docker container performance. The toolâ€™s comprehensive dashboard offers **fine-grained insights** into system health and resource utilization, facilitating proactive performance optimization and streamlined troubleshooting.

**Collect Metrics/:** Folder contains data collection scripts.

**automate_metrics_pipeline.sh:** Automates the process of starting InfluxDB and Grafana servers, running data collection scripts, and visualizing in Grafana dashboard.
## Tech Stack

**Operating System:** Linux 

**Data Collection:** SAR (System Activity Report), Docker commands 

**Database:** InfluxDB (time-series data storage)

**Visualization:** Grafana (for real-time dashboards) 

**Languages:** Shell scripting (Bash) 


## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- **Linux OS** with sar command available for system metrics.
- **InfluxDB:** Follow the installation guide [here](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1/introduction/install/).
- **Grafana:** Follow the installation guide [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/). 


### Usage

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/Advanced-Continuous-Monitoring-System.git
  cd Advanced-Continuous-Monitoring-System

```
**2. Configure Database Settings:** Update common_functions.sh with your InfluxDB connection details if different from the defaults.

**3. Run the Automated Pipeline:** Execute the automate_metrics_pipeline.sh file, which automates the entire setup process: 
- Starts InfluxDB and Grafana servers.
- Runs data collection scripts to gather system and Docker metrics.
- Pushes data to InfluxDB for storage.
- Opens Grafana to display real-time visualizations.

```
 ./automate_metrics_pipeline.sh
```
